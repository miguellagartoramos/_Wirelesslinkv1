                    <p>Along with cooling, cable management is one of the most pressing challenges encountered by network installers and IT technicians in server rooms and data centers. Even a cursory internet search will turn up countless examples of data center cabling disasters, with network cables looking like messy spaghetti. This isn't the way it has to be.</p>
                    <p>Tackling your rack cable management during set-up and installation of server cabinets will ensure that it's easy to expand, reconfigure and perform maintenance without having to worry about unplugging the wrong thing or navigating through the tangled cables. Vertical/horizontal cable managers and cable trays are great ways to secure, bundle and route your cables to make sure everything is easy to access and identify. And be sure to check out our range of patch panels for all network cables, include fiber optics.</p>

            <h2>5 Different Types of Rack Cable Managemen</h2>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Cable management is a big deal – otherwise we wouldn’t be in business! The fact of the matter is that keeping cables properly organized is one of the biggest challenges faced when working with server rooms and data centers. Having cables haphazardly thrown around will make your work a giant headache, and not to mention it can damage the wires and cause other hazards. </p>

                <h4><strong>I.</strong> Horizontal Cable Management</h4>
                <p>Horizontal cable managers are ideal for coax, fiber, copper wiring, patch cords, and other various needs. Cables and whatever you use them in are investments that needs to be protected and keeping things organized is step one. When working with a lot of complicated cables, you are bound to have excess. Our variety of horizontal cable managers ensures that they are kept neat and safely out of harm’s way. </p>

                <h4><strong>II.</strong> Vertical Cable Management</h4>
                <p>Vertical organizers are similar to the previous category except for their orientation, just as the name implies. They are perfect for keeping racks and enclosures organized. Additionally, they hold cables in a way that ensures that airflow is never compromised and everything is neatly and safely held in place. Also, vertical managers ultimately give you additional space by keeping everything consolidated. </p>

                <h4><strong>III.</strong> Cable Tray Systems</h4>
                <p>Cable trays allow you to run wires neatly from location to location, usually in the ceiling or in the floor. Depending on your needs, there are different types of cable tray systems ranging from basket-like systems that allow for a great airflow to solid trays that offer a strong level of protection. The type you will need also largely depends on where you want to house your wires – in the ground, in the ceiling, or perhaps even suspended from the ceiling if you are in an industrial environment. </p>

                <h4><strong>IV.</strong> Patch Panels</h4>
                <p>For datacom and telecom networks, patch panels come in a range of different set ups. A patch panel is essentially a board that allows you to connect wires in various combinations with a number of electric sockets. Similarly, it keeps things organized and contained so that wires aren’t hanging out all over the place. </p>

                <h4><strong>V.</strong> Fiber Optic Patch Panels</h4>
                <p>Just like regular patch panels, these allow you to organize your cables for whatever application you need, but these are specifically geared towards fiber optic cables. Our variety of different brands allows you to get the best possible use out of your data center or server room.</p>
